## Requirements

To build a simple weather forecast application based on the OpenWeatherMap API
( https://www.openweathermap.org/api ). You can sign up for a free account and API key
at https://www.openweathermap.org/appid .
Tasks
 - Create a “Current Temperature” page that fetches and displays the current temperature
at the user’s current location.
See https://www.openweathermap.org/current for relevant documentation.

- Add a “5 Day Temperatures” page to your application that fetches and displays the 5 day
forecast for the user’s current location. Display all of the 3-hourly forecasts within this 5
day period.

- See https://www.openweathermap.org/forecast5 for relevant documentation.

- The user should be able to access this "5 Day Forecast" page from the "Current
Temperature" page. You may choose the navigation pattern used. For example, both
pages could be top-level tabs within your application.
Each row in the list should display:
    - The forecast date and time
    - The forecast temperature in Fahrenheit
    - The OpenWeatherMap icon that represents the forecast weather conditions.

See https://openweathermap.org/weather-conditions for relevant documentation.
